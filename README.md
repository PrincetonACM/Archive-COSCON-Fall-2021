Solutions and [tentative standings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dQdykKqs9mz5Dp2FfJdrDd5ynpAlgawoOHSabxArGsc/edit?usp=sharing) are out. 
You have until **Saturday, November 20th at 11.59 PM** to dispute any parts of our scoring. Please look over the solutions and check our numbers, particularly if you’re currently winning an award or are close to winning an award!

The challenge period is mainly to ensure that our calculations have been correct. Challenges should be sent to coscon.written.submission@gmail.com, with a cc to ptonacm@princeton.edu and the problem author. Things that you can (and should) dispute are

- If we misrecorded your HackerRank score or the timestamp of your last submitted answer.
- If you believe that the offline grading for problems 4, 5, or 6 is not consistent with tests of your submission on your own end.
- If on a written problem you believe your solution met a criteria on the rubric and we didn’t give you the points it deserved. For example: you identified the PRG as an LFSR in problem six but got no credit.

Examples of things we will **not** be open to dispute:

- The rubrics/points we awarded for partially correct solutions on the written problems. For example, we will not be changing the fact that a solution that could only handle *n* enqueues and then *n* dequeues in problem 5a will only receive three points.
- Who the most inquisitive team and the raffle prize winner were.

We encourage you to look over the solutions even if you weren’t close to winning and reach out if you have any questions, or are just interested in learning more. For every coding problem, we have at least a C++ and Java solution (and sometimes a Python solution), so you should feel free to run those and study how they work if you’re interested. COSCON’s primary goal, after all, is to help you explore new challenges in computer science and learn!
